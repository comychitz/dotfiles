# dotfiles
A collection of my configuration files:
* vim
* bash 
* emacs (just started)

## vim
Currently, I like to use vim for all my development (which is usually C/C++ on Linux based systems)
* see vim/.vimrc 

## emacs
Lately I've been pushing myself to learn emacs, mainly for org-mode. 
* see emacs/.emacs

## bash
* see bash/.bash_profile
